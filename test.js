console.log(sentiment("The number one drawback on Davis is his overall strength, or lack thereof .. Despite his youth, he is unquestionably thin and the issue remains just how much weight he can add, and how that added weight will affect his speed and agility ... His shoulders suggest he can build on his frame, and he’s noticeably chiseled his arms, however a thin waist likely means he won;t be able to bulk up substantially ... Must work on his core and lower body- easily gets pinned and backed down in the paint ... Unable to establish and maintain position inside, often finding himself bumped off balance ... Rarely used in isolation post-up’s during his freshman campaign, particularly given his size advantage on many nights and solid footwork ... Offensive canvas is raw, with obvious enormous room for improvement ... Doesn’t yet have a feel for his jump shot, often rushing the attempt and shooting a flat shot ... There are times where he displays extreme comfort handling the ball, but face-up/dribble-drive maneuvers are few and far between ... While he’s a tremendous secondary and tertiary leaper, he too often leaves his feet on pump fakes ... It’s hard to fault him for being shot block happy, but the lack of discipline is not to his benefit ... His athleticism and length won’t cover up all shortcomings against super competition ... Projecting Davis going forward, there’s not much to dislike ... Physical maturity is the only visible hurdle standing in his path to beast Fluid athleticism incredible length and guard agility in a 6’10 package Davis is a game wrecking defensive presence and disruptor unlike any incoming draft prospect in quite some time 4.8 BPG ... He combines the physical shot blocking package of a 7’6 wingspan and quick leaping ability with a relentless motor and high-level defensive intelligence ... In addition to his length, the speed at which he chews up ground allows him to affect shots all over the court ... He has phenomenal recovery speed and can cover up the defensive blemishes of teammates ... Single-handedly suffocates opponents physically and mentally, as they know all attempts within his vicinity will be heavily contested at minimum ... Looks like a natural guarding on the perimeter, with quick feet and exceptional hands for a man his size- averages 1.5 steals per game, an unheard of figure at the college center spot ... Rarely gets into foul difficulty despite his aggressive, attack every shot nature ... Davis uses his freakish gifts on the boards as well, snatching nearly 10 rebounds 3 off. in 31 minutes of action ... Not afraid to mix it up on the interior despite his frail build ... Highly efficient offensive weapon 13.8 PPG, 65% FG ... Predominantly an off-the ball target, cleaning up on alley-oops both off the pick and roll and dribble hands offs ... Few passes are out of reach, seemingly able to elevate as high as required. RUNS the court ... While not necessarily a power finisher, his explosiveness of the deck is effortless ... Capable of mid-air body adjustments on errant passes ... Displays the body control to hang and alter release to finish through a bump ... His jump shot form is aesthetically pleasing 71% FT, and its effectiveness certainly can be cultivated with work and experience ... Shows glimpses of pick and pop aptitude ... Bullet outlet passes are a major strength ... Can handle the ball in space with occasional facilitation of the offense, and does not appear limited to straight line drives ...
