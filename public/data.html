    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>    
        Sentiment analysis is a technique to extract opinionated information from a text.  It uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP), text analysis, and  The goal of the project was to perform sentiment analysis on potential NBA players’ scouting reports prior to them being drafted and compare that to their performance in the NBA.  This will allow us to look for patterns and and make judgements about how effective pre-draft scouting reports and the media’s perception of the player is at predicting success in the NBA.  Our data will be scraped off of the internet; this includes the pre-draft scouting reports, news articles about the specific players, player headshots, as well as their stats after playing in the NBA.  This will be presented as a web application in which the user can select the draft year and then the player to get results for.

    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>    
        The goal of this project is to determine a quantifiable way to measure the accuracy of scouting reports and media portrayals of players in terms of how they predict success in the NBA.  The metric used to measure media portrayals used was a sentiment score obtained from the analysis of articles and scouting reports on the player.  These scores ranged between -2 and 8.  Positive and negative sentiment scores correspond to positive and negative media portrayals, respectively.  To measure player performance, we used Player Efficiency Ratings (PER).  This is an all-encompassing metric that takes a multitude of other statistics into account.  An average player will have a PER score of 12 to 15 while a very good player will have a score in the mid to high 20's.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, we found that the more positive a player's sentiment score was, the better the performed.  Some exceptions to this include players who had off-court incidents and violations such as drug or crime problems.  These caused severe media backlash and had a significant negative impact on their sentiment score, even though in some cases, they performed very well on the court.  As with any kind of prediction, there is always some level of uncertainty and player scouting is no different.  Some players with very high sentiment scores underperformed, and some players with low sentiment scores played very well.

   <!--  <h1>Journals and Impact Factors</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>To go deeper into our data set, we looked into the impact factor (IF) of the academic journal hosting the article. The impact factor is a measure that illustrates the number of citations to articles published in the journal. We used this factor and compared it with the polarity of the article to detect potential bias in journals.</p>

    <h1>Future Work</h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>
        Another cool idea to think about in the future, is to be able to grade a specific scout’s ability to write an accurate scouting report for a player entering the NBA draft. A measure like this could change the entire scouting industry, as it would make scouts much more responsible for the veracity of their claims if there was a firm, quantifiable method to confirm or contradict the content of their scouting reports. Also, our analysis shows that there is definitely a way to cross the bridge from older, more traditional metrics to newer methods of analytics in the NBA.

        The bulk of this project can be easily adapted to find correlations to other basketball metrics and even other sports too.  For instance, instead of analyzing all players, we could look only at players at a particular position (i.e. only look at point guards and their assist-to-turnover ratio or only look at centers and their defensive win shares).  Combining this with the aforementioned extension could create a method to systematically classify scouts based on what positions they evaluate best.  Furthermore, topic analysis could be used to see if there was a pattern betweens players associated with certain things (i.e. performance enhancing drugs or charity work) and certain statistics.  Finally, this program can be extended to other sports as well.  Adapting the code to analyze correlations between the media and scouts perceptions of NFL players and their on-field performance would simply involve changing the sources that we scrape data from and making the front-end design NFL oriented.
